# Data Pipeline 2

### Kubeflow implementation of pipelines and components

On the last session we discover components and pipelines

Now we will go further on our pipeline to add component that will made it production oriented.

We will also use Kserve to serve our model and try onlines predictions.


- First, upgrade the pipeline with model export en s3, better preprocessing [3_upgraded_taxi_tips.ipynb](3_upgraded_taxi_tips.ipynb)

- Then let'sput our model in service and query it [4_serving_chicago_model.ipynb](4_serving_chicago_model.ipynb)
